# Pocket Penguin :penguin:

Pocket Penguin is a simple web-based game in which you interact with a small penguin inside an igloo. The goal is to keep the penguin’s mood up. To do this, the user can buy items using the in-game currency, snow, and use them on the penguin to increase its mood.

### Mood Meter
Located in the top left panel. Consists of 3 hearts. The game starts with two hearts filled. Every 10 seconds, the mood meter decreases by 1.

### Snow
Located in the top right panel. Currency used in-game. Snow is awarded when the user interacts with (clicks) the penguin. The amount of snow given depends on the mood:
Three hearts: +4 snow.
Two hearts: +3 snow.
One heart: +2 snow.
Zero hearts: +1 snow.

### Items
Items come in three categories: food, toys, and decor. Each item costs a certain amount of snow and offers either a certain amount of mood points or time to which the mood meter decreases. Each item category has its own menu that holds its respective item (collectively called the store, located on the left-hand panel). Once bought, the item can be accessed in its inventory located on the right panel: eat, play, and furnish.

* **Food:**  Can be bought any number of times. Provides a certain number of mood points which are automatically given to the penguin upon use. Can be accessed in the Eat menu.

* **Toys:** Functions similarly to food, except for minigames, which will not award the mood points unless completed. Can be accessed in the Play menu.

* **Decor:** Can only be bought once. Provides extra time to the mood meter. Once in its inventory, it can be added or removed from the penguin’s igloo. The added time is only applied when the item is placed in the igloo. Can be accessed in the Furnish menu.
